			<div class="content">
				<p>
				Bharat Bhargava is a professor of the Department of Computer Science with a courtesy appointment in the School of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at Purdue University. Professor Bhargava is conducting research in security and privacy issues in distributed systems. This involves host authentication and key management, secure routing and dealing with malicious hosts, adaptability to attacks, and experimental studies. His recent work is on Intelligent Autonomous Systems and data analytics and machine learning. It includes cognitive autonomy, reflexivity, deep learning and knowledge discovery. His earlier work on Waxed Prune with MIT and NGC built a prototype for privacy preserving data dissemination in cross-domains. Based on his research in reliability, he is studying vulnerabilities in systems to assess threats to large organizations. He has developed techniques to avoid threats that can lead to operational failures. The research has direct impact on nuclear waste transport, bio-security, disaster management, and homeland security. These ideas and scientific principles are being applied to the building of secure networks and systems.

				<br/><br/> Professor Bhargava is recipient of seven best paper awards in various international computer science conferences. Professor Bhargava is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and of the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers. In 1999, he received the IEEE Technical Achievement Award for a major impact of his decade long contributions to foundations of adaptability in communication and distributed systems. He has been awarded the charter Gold Core Member distinction by the IEEE Computer Society for his distinguished service. He received Outstanding Instructor Awards from the Purdue chapter of the ACM in 1996 and 1998. He has graduated the largest number of Ph.D students in CS department and is active in supporting/mentoring minority students. In 2003, he was inducted in the Purdue's Book of Great Teachers. In 2017, he received the Helen Schleman Gold Medallion Award for supporting women at Purdue and Focus award for advancing technology for differently abled students.

				<br/><br/> He serves on seven editorial boards of international journals. He also served on the IEEE Computer Society on Technical Achievement award and Fellow committees. Professor Bhargava is the founder of the IEEE Symposium on Reliable and Distributed Systems, IEEE conference on Digital Library, and the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management.

				<p>
				
				Kavita Bala is the Chair of the Computer Science Department at Cornell University. She received her S.M. and Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and her B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT, Bombay). She was a post doctoral researcher at the Program of Computer Graphics. She co-founded GrokStyle (acquired by Facebook), and is a faculty Fellow with the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future.
				Bala specializes in computer vision and computer graphics, leading research in recognition and visual search using deep learning; material modeling and acquisition using physics and learning; realistic, physically-based rendering; and material and lighting perception. Bala's work on scalable rendering, Lightcuts, is the core production rendering engine in Autodesk's cloud renderer; and her instance recognition research is the core technology of GrokStyle's visual search engine. Her work on 3D Mandalas was featured at the Rubin Museum of Art, New York.
				<br/>
				Bala serves on SIGGRAPH's Papers Advisory Group (PAG). Bala has served as the Editor-in-Chief of Transactions on Graphics (TOG), on the Papers Advisory Board for SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia, and as Associate Editor for TOG (Transactions on Graphics), TVCG (Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics) and CGF (Computer Graphics Forum). Bala has co-authored the graduate-level textbook "Advanced Global Illumination" (A K Peters publisher, second edition). She has chaired SIGGRAPH Asia 2011, and co-chaired Pacific Graphics (2010) and the Eurographics Symposium on Rendering (2005).
				<br/>
				Bala has received the NSF CAREER award, Cornell's College of Engineering Fiona Li and Donald Li Excellence in Teaching Award (2015), James and Mary Tien Excellence in Teaching Award (2006 and 2009), and the Affinito-Stewart award.

				<br/><b>Title: Determinism and energy efficiency in Industrial IoT</b> <br/><br/>

				<p>
				Industrial applications, such as smart grid, smart manufacturing or 
				automotive industry applications, require ultra low-latency, ultra 
				low-power consumption and high network reliability. The Time Slotted 
				Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE802.15.4 can provide these 
				characteristics; however, as all the wireless technologies, it is prone 
				to internal and external interference. A number of techniques to 
				mitigate or avoid potential collisions since the formation of the 
				network is described. Moreover, promising wireless power transfer 
				methods are introduced to provide energy efficiency and even power 
				autonomy to Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications.
				
				</p><br/>

				Christos Douligeris, currently a professor at the department of 
				Informatics, University of Piraeus, Greece held positions with the 
				Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of 
				Miami. He was an associate member of the Hellenic Authority for 
				Information and Communication Assurance and Privacy and the President 
				and CEO of Hellenic Electronic Governance for Social Security SA.Dr. 
				Douligeris has published extensively in the networking scientific 
				literature and he has participated in many research and development 
				projects. He is the co-editor of a book on ‘‘Network Security’’
